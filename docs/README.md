# 2025SE-Crawford.L-HSCTask2

This will be used to predict the weather at Sydney Airport ([YSSY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport)).

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## MLOps

### Design Stage

#### Business Problem:

Pilots don't exactly know what weather to expect in the future, instead they just get past weather (within 30 mins â€“ 1 hour or quicker if the weather is changing rapidly).

#### Success Metrics:

Be able to predict the weather within the next 10-30 mins to above 50% accuracy.

#### Data Columns:

```
time,wmo,name,history_product,air_temp,apparent_t,dewpt,rel_hum,delta_t,wind_dir_deg,wind_spd_kmh,gust_kmh,rain_trace,rain_ten,rain_hour,duration_from_9am,press,lat,lon,location
```

| Column          | Discription                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| time            | The timestamp of when the weather was recorded. |
| wmo             | The ID of the weather station.                  |
| name            | The human-friendly name of the weather station. |
| history_product | The ID for BOM identification.                  |
|                 |                                                 |
